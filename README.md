# CarND-Vehicle-Detection
Computer vision techniques to detect vehicles

The steps of the study include:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier.
* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to the HOG feature vector. 
* Normalize the features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run the software pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
